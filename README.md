# Next.js 15 Server Component Circular Dependency Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15's server components where circular dependencies can lead to silent failures or unexpected behavior during rendering.

## Problem
When server components have circular dependencies, the error is not always apparent. It may manifest as unexpected behavior or a silent crash without a clear error message.  This makes debugging significantly more challenging.

## Solution
The primary solution is to refactor your code to remove the circular dependency. Analyze the components' import statements to identify and break the cycle.  Refactoring might involve creating helper functions, moving shared logic to a separate module, or rethinking the component structure.
